    <h1>What Is VRHome?</h1>
    <p>VRHome is a virtual reality program created to control your smart home from a Virtual Reality Headset</p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>We knew it must be easier than it is now to combine the virtual world with the physical. A blending of the physical and virtual realities through the home.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>How is it going to work?</h2> 
    <p>VRHome is going to be connected with all smart devices in a home with a single internet connection and will be manipulatable by using hand signals like waving at a lightbulb to turn it on</p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>When?</h2>
    <p>We are aiming to release VRHome in the next few months</p>
    <br>
